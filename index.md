## Work and Research

### Current Place of Work
I'm currently working on the development of [OpenMLS](https://github.com/openmls/openmls), where [Raphael](https://github.com/raphaelrobert), [Franziskus](https://github.com/franziskuskiefer) and I are building an open-source implementation of MLS in Rust. In my spare cycles, I'm working on my PhD and am still following my research interests.

### Research Interests
Together with my advisors [Christopher Brzuska](http://www.chrisbrzuska.de/) and [Markulf Kohlweiss](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mkohlwei/), I work on bridging the gap between security proofs of composed security protocols and their implementations.

In particular, I work with the State-Separating Proofs (SSP) methodology (see [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/306) for details), which can help with building modular security definitions and proofs, as well as with their visualization.

On the more applied side, I am involved in the [MLS working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/) at the IETF, where together with other participants from academia and industry, I work on the design of a modern secure messaging protocol that supports large groups.

### Upcoming Events
For anyone interested in the "State-Separated Proofs" framework (see the Paper
below), there is a a workshop ([WoDUP](http://www.chrisbrzuska.de/WoDUP.html))
coming up on the 9th of May. It is conveniently colocated with EuroCrypt!
