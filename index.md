## Work and Research

### Current Place of Work
I'm currently working at [Phoenix R&D](https://phnx.im), where [Raphael](https://twitter.com/raphaelrobert), [Julian](https://twitter.com/mairjulian) and I are working on security and privacy enhancing technologies in the secure messaging space.

Together with our friends at [Cryspen](https://github.com/franziskuskiefer), we are also maintaing [OpenMLS](https://openmls.tech), a free and open source implementation of the messaging layer security protocol written in rust.

### Research Interests
Research-wise, I'm interested in cryptographic protocols for real-world applications with a focus on key exchange protocols in general and secure (group) messaging protocols in particular.

Besides the academic treatment of such protocols, I'm also interested in protocol design and implementations (with a focus on Rust). More concretely, I'm actively involved in the [MLS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/) and [MIMI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mimi/about/) working groups at the IETF.
