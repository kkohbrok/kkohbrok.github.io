## Work and Research

### Current Place of Work
I'm currently working at [Phoenix R&D](https://phnx.im), where [Raphael](https://twitter.com/raphaelrobert), [Julian](https://twitter.com/mairjulian) and I are working on security and privacy enhancing technologies in the secure messaging space.

Together with our friends at [Cryspen](https://github.com/franziskuskiefer), we are also maintaing [OpenMLS](https://openmls.tech), a free and open source implementation of the messaging layer security protocol written in rust.

### Research Interests
Together with my advisors [Christopher Brzuska](http://www.chrisbrzuska.de/) and [Markulf Kohlweiss](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mkohlwei/), I work on bridging the gap between security proofs of composed security protocols and their implementations as part of my PhD.

In particular, I work with the State-Separating Proofs (SSP) methodology (see [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/306) for details), which can help with building modular security definitions and proofs, as well as with their visualization.

On the more applied side, I am involved in the [MLS working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/) at the IETF, where together with other participants from academia and industry, I work on the design of a modern secure messaging protocol that supports large groups.
